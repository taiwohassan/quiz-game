### README: Computer Quiz Python Script

#### Overview
This Python script is an interactive quiz game that tests the user's knowledge of computer-related acronyms. The quiz contains four multiple-choice questions about the meanings of common computer terms. It keeps track of the user's score and calculates their percentage at the end of the game.

#### How It Works

1. Game Introduction:

   - The program welcomes the user with a message: `"Welcome to my computer quiz!"`.
   - The user is prompted to decide whether they want to play by entering `"yes"` or any other response.

2. *Quiz Logic*:

   - If the user agrees to play (`"yes"`), the game begins. Otherwise, the program exits (`quit()`).
   - The user is asked four questions about computer-related terms:
     - What does **CPU** stand for?
     - What does **GPU** stand for?
     - What does **RAM** stand for?
     - What does **PSU** stand for?

3. **Answer Checking**:
   - For each question, the user's input is compared to the correct answer (case-insensitive).
   - If the answer is correct, the program increments the score and displays `"Correct!"`.
   - If incorrect, it displays `"Incorrect"`.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   - At the end of the quiz, the program displays the total number of correct answers.
   - It also calculates and displays the user's score as a percentage.

#### Features
- **Case-Insensitive Answers**: Users can enter answers in uppercase, lowercase, or a mix of both (e.g., `CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT` or `central processing unit`).
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users decide whether to play or quit before starting the quiz.
- **Score Feedback**: The program provides immediate feedback after each question and a final score summary.
